This is my nvim config. Everything (for now) comes from those very cool setup of [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHTeCSVAFNY)

Bassically the [init.lua](./init.lua) file just install the package manager (in this case this [lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).

Then all the plugins are configured in the [lua/plugins](lua/plugins) folder.

There is also a file called [lua/vim-options.lua](lua/vim-options.lua) which contains keymap. 
This should still be extended.
